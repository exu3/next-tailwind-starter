# Next.js starter with Tailwind.

Plenty of these exist, but this is my Next.js starter with Tailwind.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Feilla1%2Fnext-tailwind-starter)

This one inclues [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes), and [swr](https://github.com/vercel/swr).

Included fonts (self-hosted) are DM Sans and Inconsolata. This starter also has some utility classes for containers and typography styles which can be found in `styles/globals.css`.

## To get started

1. Clone this repository as a template
2. To install dependencies, run: `$ yarn install`
3. To start the development server, run: `$ yarn dev`
4. To format / lint, run: `$ yarn lint:fix`

## Dependencies

The included Dependabot configuration file means you’ll automatically get PRs every Monday with dependency updates. Delete `.github/dependabot.yml` to disable.
